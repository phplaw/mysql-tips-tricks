Sometime, we need allow user to connect from remote host, so in this case, 
we have to create new user for this kind of connection. Here the way to do that: 
```sql
SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;
DROP USER 'root'@'%';
-- ALLOW access to all db with password from any host
GRANT ALL ON *.* to remoteroot@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_pasword';
-- allow with only localhost
GRANT ALL ON *.* to remoteroot@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_pasword';
DROP USER 'remoteroot'@'localhost';
-- allo connnect to foo db with an ip address for user bar
GRANT ALL ON foo.* TO bar@'192.168.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON foo.* FROM bar@'192.168.0.1';
```
